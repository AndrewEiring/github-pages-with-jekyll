I'm from the other (a little more sunny) Bay Area, Tampa Bay, Florida. I spend my time with my small family, making music and tasty dishes, and generally helping people, whenter personally or professionally, that's what makes me happy.</p>

After spending a few years in the kitchen with my father who was a chef, I decided to try out a corporate job and work in sales and customer service. After a few years of work, and a few more promotions, I decided this is where I wanted to stay. I was then offered a position as Offshore Operations Manager in the Philippines and off I went. I worked in Manila for about 3 years before taking a remote position is Software Customer Support and found that this is the industry I wanted to be in and continue my passion for providing exceptional customer experiences.
